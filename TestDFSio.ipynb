    "## HDFS: the Hadoop Distributed File System \n",
    "\n",
    "Large amounts of data are collected every day that traditional technologies cannot handle. \"Big Data\" has become the catch-all term for massive amounts of data as well as for frameworks and R&D initiatives aimed at  working with it efficiently. [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) is one of the most widely adopted such frameworks for Big Data processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two core component of Hadoop are the Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS and the cluster and resource manager YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiatior).\n",
    "\n",
    "The file system HDFS is designed to run on clusters of computers and provides a reliable and efficient solution for working with large (in the GB or even TB scale) datasets. HDFS is written in Java and was originally inspired by the Google File System (GFS or GoogleFS), providing its open-source alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core features of HDFS is *fault tolerance* or *high availability*: this is the capability of a system to maintain continuous operations even in the event of failure of one of its parts (both hardware or software). Fault tolerance in HDFS is achieved through *data replication*: data is simply stored in multiple copies across different hosts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a diagram showing the architecture of a Hadoop cluster. The NameNode is responsible for storing the filesystem's metadata, whereas DataNodes store the actual data. While data storage is fault-tolerant, the name node might constitute a single point-of-failure. Therefore typically one standby NameNode service runs on one of the data nodes, providing a backup in case of failure of the main NameNode. \n",
    "\n",
 "\n",
    "![HDFS Architecture](HDFS_Architecture.png)",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop's file system reliability through data replication clearly comes at the cost of performance. Many data processing scenarios (also known as  extract, transform, load, or ETL procedures) consist a sequence of MapReduce jobs. The two main performance shortcomings in iterative computations are due to the interplay of\n",
    "\n",
    "- intermediate data storage\n",
    "- replication \n",
    "\n",
    "Intermediate data in fact needs to be persisted at each step in multiple copies (the number of copies is the HDFS replication factor, typically ≥ 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "## TestDFSio\n",
    "\n",
    "TestDFSio is a tool for measuring the performance of read and write operations on HDFS and can be used to measure performance, benchmark, or stress-test a Hadoop cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "TestDFSio uses `MapReduce` to write files to the HDFS filesystem spanning one mapper for file; the reducer is used to collect and summarize test data."

    "### TestDFSIO basic usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To run write or read tests you first need to locate the test file `hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient*tests.jar`. In our Cloudera installation this is located in:\n",

    "- `-write` to run write tests\n",
    "- `-read` to run read tests\n",
    "- `-nrFiles` the number of files (set to be equal to the number of mappers)\n",
    "- `-fileSize` size of files (followed by B|KB|MB|GB|TB)\n",
    "\n",
    "TestDFSIO generates exactly 1 map task per file, so it is a 1:1 mapping from files to map tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specify custom i/o directory\n",
    "\n",
    " to avoid permission problems (you need to have read/write access to `/benchmarks/TestDFSIO` on HDFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default TestHDFSio uses the HDFS directory `/benchmarks` to read and write, therefore it is recommended to run the tests as `hdfs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you want to run the tests as a user who has no write permissions on HDFS' root folder (`/`), you can specify an alternative directory with the `-D` assigning a new value to `test.build.data`:"
