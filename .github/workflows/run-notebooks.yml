# work in progress
# this action runs two jobs: List-Notebook-Files and Run-Notebooks
# Run-Notebooks converts ipynb files to Python with nbconvert and runs them on the Ubuntu box
# (at the moment this is done only for one file since not all notebook files are ready)
# also it would be better to create an image instead of downloading software every time
